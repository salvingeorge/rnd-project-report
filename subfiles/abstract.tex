        This research addresses the challenge of efficient radioactive source localization using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We present an integrated 
        framework that combines physics-based radiation simulation with systematic evaluation methods, comparing three distinct approaches: information-gain-based, rollout-based,
        and inverse square law optimization algorithms. Through experiments and evaluation across multiple source configurations, we demonstrate how each method, while
        being able to localize similarly, has significantly different convergence speeds. Statistical analysis reveals that the information-gain-based approach consistently achieves the fastest convergence (44 to 126 seconds), 
        followed by the rollout algorithm (90-177 seconds), significantly outperforming the baseline method. This work establishes quantitative benchmarks for autonomous radiation detection systems with direct
        applications in nuclear security and emergency response scenarios.
